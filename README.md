# Linelet
A Novel Linelet-based Representation for Line Segment Detection.

Followings are brief description of each script.

- Demo_main.m: our method is implemented in this script. Please note that current version has been updated since submission for better performance -- the results reported in the paper are stored in "./result/proposed" folder. For an example demonstration, we set this script to detect from image #22 of the dataset. To run over the whole image, you can modify the loop part (line 31) of the code.

- Demo_evaluation.m: you can check the performance comparison of methods. 

- Demo_evaluation_OriginalYorkUrban.m: same as "Demo_evaluation.m" except the original annotation set [11] is used as ground truth. 

- Directories: "DB" contains the original and proposed annotation sets. The file link is not made yet. "funcs" and "toolbox" contain several functions, such as steps in the paper and others. "result" store detection results of proposed method. "visualization" stores detection results drawn on each image.

Please note that current version is not well optimized.
